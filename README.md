# This project aims to analyze the historical performance of three automobile companies—Ford (F), Honda (HMC), and Toyota (TM)—by constructing and comparing various stock indexes such as value-weighted, price-weighted, and equal-weighted indexes. Additionally, it compares the performance of three market indexes—NASDAQ 100, Russell 2003, and S&P 500—over a 20-year period (December 2003 to December 2023). Through calculating returns, key statistical metrics, and portfolio values, this analysis provides insights into stock movements and market trends, helping to understand the behavior of these indexes in varying market conditions.
